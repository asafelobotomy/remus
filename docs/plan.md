# Retro Library Manager – Plan

## Goal
Build a desktop app that scans retro game libraries, fetches metadata, matches files, and safely renames/moves/organizes ROMs and disc images. First-class Linux support via AppImage.

## Recommended Tech Stack
- UI: CLI (Qt 6 Console) — *GUI/TUI archived, see `archive/gui-tui/`*
- Core: C++17/20
- DB: SQLite
- Networking: QtNetwork (HTTP, caching)
- Image: QtImage (artwork decoding/resize)
- Packaging: AppImage (linuxdeployqt or go-appimage/appimagetool)
- CI: GitHub Actions

## Alternate Stack (if you prefer web UI)
- UI: Tauri + Svelte/React
- Core: Rust
- DB: SQLite
- Packaging: Tauri AppImage bundler (linuxdeploy) or go-appimage

- Stable database schema

### M2 — Metadata layer (Weeks 3–4) ✅ COMPLETED

**Goal**: Connect to metadata providers to enrich scanned files.

**Implementation Details**:
- ✅ Provider adapters with unified metadata schema
- ✅ Rate limiting, retries, caching (30-day SQLite cache)
- ✅ Fetch by hash (ScreenScraper) and by name (all providers)
- ✅ ScreenScraper: Hash + name matching (CRC32/MD5/SHA1)
- ✅ TheGamesDB: Name matching with artwork
- ✅ IGDB: Twitch OAuth with rich metadata
- ✅ Artwork downloader with progress tracking
- ✅ CLI integration (--metadata, --search commands)

**Research Update (Feb 2026)**:

- 🔍 Found **RetroAchievements** - hash verification + achievements
- 🔍 Located additional hash databases: GameTDB, gc-forever, PS3 IRD, Renascene
- 📋 **Recommendation**: Add Hasheous in M3 as primary hash fallback
- 📄 See [docs/metadata-providers.md](metadata-providers.md) for detailed comparison

Deliverables:

- ✅ Provider orchestrator with smart fallback:
  1. Hasheous (hash, priority 100) → FREE, no auth
  2. ScreenScraper (hash, priority 90) → if authenticated
  3. TheGamesDB (name, priority 50) → free name search
  4. IGDB (name, priority 40) → richest metadata
- ✅ Matching pipeline: hash → exact name → fuzzy name
- ✅ Confidence scoring system:
  - 100%: Hash match OR user confirmation
  - 90%: Exact filename match
  - 50-80%: Fuzzy match (Levenshtein distance)

  - Workaround: Test DAT before import

## Research & Standards

Remus adheres to industry-standard naming conventions and best practices:

- **No-Intro Convention** - Gold standard for cartridge-based ROM naming
- **Redump Convention** - Gold standard for disc-based game naming
- **CHD Format** - MAME's Compressed Hunks of Data for disc image compression
- **M3U Playlists** - Standard format for multi-disc game organization
- **RetroArch Compatibility** - Optimized for RetroArch playlist scanner
- **ES-DE Compatibility** - Compatible with EmulationStation DE scraper
- **EmuDeck/RetroDeck** - Follows Steam Deck emulation standards

See [naming-standards.md](naming-standards.md) and [chd-conversion.md](chd-conversion.md) for detailed documentation.

## Research Notes
- AppImage best practice: build on the oldest still-supported Ubuntu LTS for widest compatibility.
- linuxdeployqt is widely used for Qt but is no longer actively maintained; go-appimage/appimagetool is recommended by the maintainer for future-proofing.
- ScreenScraper access typically requires a user account; plan for credentials storage and rate limiting.
